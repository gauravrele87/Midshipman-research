# Midshipman-research
This is my masters degree thesis research based on the effect of anthropogenic ship noise on plainfin midshipman.
All of the coding is done in MATLAB
the file called from Matlab is callshp.m which uses 15 minute WAV files created by Dr. Roger Bland from the hydrophone at Romberg Tiburon Center.
